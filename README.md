##JamBox

###About
JamBox is a community project that uses Perforce solutions to support collaboration for [Game Jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam).    
It is essentially a Perforce server and a customized version of Swarm.
This project resides primarily on the [Perforce Workshop](https://swarm.workshop.perforce.com/projects/thomas_gray-jambox/), which includes builds for Docker and Raspberry Pi.  This GitHub mirror of the main branch exists for convenience.
